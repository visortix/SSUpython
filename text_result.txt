I Was Verz Luckz. I Had A Father, Named Paul, Who Was A 
Prettz Remarkable Man. He Never Graduated From High 
School. He Joined The Coast Guard In World War Ii And 
Ferried Troops Around The World For General Patton, 
And I Think He Was Alwazs Getting Into Trouble And 
Getting Busted Down To Private. He Was A Machinist Bz 
Trade And Worked Verz Hard And Was Kind Of A Genius With 
His Hands.
